# MaintEnhance (formerly HomeKeep) — Changelog

Every entry below corresponds to one delivered docker build — `homekeep-docker`
through v1.7, `maintenhance-docker` from v1.8 onward (see the v1.8 entry
below) — and, where noted, an updated functional spec. Versions **v0.1–v0.8**
were pre-release builds. **v1** is the first official release, and is
the point where the zip's top-level folder and the zip filename began
carrying a matching `-vN` suffix, with the spec and this changelog
included inside the zip itself. From v1 onward, the functional spec
file (`Home_CMMS_Functional_Specification.md`) carries no version
suffix of its own — it lives in the GitHub repo and is versioned by
Git history instead.

From v1 onward, each entry carries a **Commit short description**
(≤50 characters, including the version number, meant to be pasted as
the Git commit's summary line) and a **Commit extended description**
(≤200 words, also naming the version, the commit body — i.e.
`git commit -m "<short>" -m "<extended>"`).

## v2.7

**Commit short description:** `v2.7: Build with AI, sidebar and UI polish`

**Commit extended description:**
v2.7 adds Build with AI. A button on the work order, work request, asset, bill of materials, location, vendor and part screens, on Work Orders (PM program) and on the PM starter catalogue opens a text box where you describe what you want and paste links. Gemini (the same GEMINI_API_KEY as link look-ups) returns a draft you review: a filled-in form, a suggested BOM, a location structure, several PM Bases as a PM program, or new PM templates. Nothing is saved until you apply it. The Owner can switch it off under Features. Other changes: the collapse-menu arrow now sits inside the left bar; Managers see the Dashboard metrics as well as Owners; page titles, menu labels and pop-up titles use proper title case; confirmation pop-ups use the primary button colour (red only for deletions and removals) and the credentials email prompt says Send. Tested in a browser harness only, not in a live deployment; the Gemini call itself could not be tried without a key.

## v2.6.1

**Commit short description:** `v2.6.1: Digest timing, app updates, change log`

**Commit extended description:**
v2.6.1 gives each person control over when their email digest arrives. In Tools and settings (and in the Owner's member settings) you now choose how often the digest is sent (every day, weekdays, or once a week on a chosen day) and the time of day; the server checks every five minutes and sends one email per person per day at most, using the server's time zone (set TZ on the container). A new digest option, App updates, is open to every role and emails the change log entries added since that person's last email. All digest options now start switched off for new accounts (existing accounts keep their choices). The left bar shows the installed version under the app name; selecting it opens the full change log, newest first. The Docker image now includes CHANGELOG.md for this. Tested in a browser harness only, not in a live deployment.

## v2.6

**Commit short description:** `v2.6: Accounts, designations, metrics, UX`

**Commit extended description:**
v2.6 implements 26 logged changes. Accounts: a user avatar menu (Account settings, Sign out) replaces the bell and key; profile photo, dark mode, install app and email digest subscriptions move into Tools, renamed Tools and settings; forced password change no longer asks for the temporary password; adding a member or resetting a password offers an editable temporary password and an optional email of the credentials (needs SMTP). Roles: executor designations Planner, Scheduler, Specialist, plus an Executor flag for Owners and Managers. Assets: category combobox, BOM copy between assets, real archived state, managers delete only unlinked assets (Archive is now Remove, with explanation). Forms: work request and work order field order and required fields, location filters assets including sub-locations, vendor removed from work orders (via parts), PM wizard catalogue collapsed. Owner dashboard metrics: requests per executor, hour efficiency, schedule compliance, lead time, verification time, reactive percentage (lead time and verification start from this release). Scheduling: shift chips open an edit modal, free-entry durations, phone-width calendars scroll sideways at 7 days wide. Help loads faster with a Top button. Tested in a browser harness only, not in a live deployment.

## v2.5.1

**Commit short description:** `v2.5.1: Confirm password, show/hide password`

**Commit extended description:**
v2.5.1 improves password entry. The first-run screen that creates the Owner account now has a Confirm password box and refuses to continue unless the two entries match. Every password box now has an eye button to show or hide what was typed: first-run setup, sign-in, emailed-reset, the forced choose-your-own-password screen, My account, and the Owner's add-member form. All input boxes now size to their container (border-box), so they no longer stick out past the edge of their card. The hint on the setup screen now says Tools instead of Owner Tools. The Manager and Owner training guide gains a First-time setup page, and the sign-in, choose-your-own-password and My account pages mention the eye button. No data or setting changes. Tested in a browser harness only, not in a live deployment.

## v2.5

**Commit short description:** `v2.5: Touch drag-and-drop, split storage`

**Commit extended description:**
v2.5 adds touch support to Labour assignment and Workforce schedule. Tap (or tap and hold) a work order card, side-list card or person's name to pick it up; it is highlighted and a banner shows what you hold, with Open and Cancel buttons. Then tap a day, a person's day, a week box or an hour slot to place it. Tapping the held card again, Cancel or Escape puts it down; changing the view also cancels. Mouse drag and drop is unchanged, and a mouse click still opens the work order. Storage is split in two: the database stays on the fast /data volume (SSD), while photo attachments, nightly snapshots and temporary import files move to a /files volume that can sit on a disc pool. New optional variables FILES_DIR, ATTACH_DIR, BACKUP_DIR and TMP_DIR; FILES_DIR defaults to DATA_DIR so single-volume installs still work. Compose takes DATA_PATH and FILES_PATH to choose host folders. Fresh installs start with empty volumes. Tested in a browser harness only, not in a live deployment; the storage split was not run against a real database.

## v2.4

**Commit short description:** `v2.4: Labour assignment & workforce schedule`

**Commit extended description:**
v2.4 renames Owner Tools to Tools, with cards by role (executors: My account, My hours; managers add Executor colours, Shift templates, hours report; owners keep the rest). Three Owner toggles, off by default: execution-based scheduling and time keeping, workforce scheduling, hourly labour assignment (needs both others). Scheduling renames Schedule to Labour assignment: work orders gain estimated hours, crew required and multiple executors; Month, Week and Day views, filters, a due-date side list, under-staffed flags and a required hours-worked prompt on completion. Workforce schedule adds daily and weekly shift templates, drag-and-drop names, overnight shifts, coverage-gap warnings and PDF export; hourly mode adds a 30-minute grid. New data is in Excel export and import. Also: a Help tab opens the training guide with a linked contents list (Word copies downloadable), (i) info buttons now cover cards, pages and pop-ups, and both training guides are updated for v2.4. Everything is renamed maintenhance (image, container, volume, database file, packages), a fresh-start release. Tested in a browser harness only, not in a live deployment.

## v2.3

**Commit short description:** `v2.3: Catalogue types, alarm beacons, link fill`

**Commit extended description:**
v2.3 merges the Home and Facilities PM starter templates into one catalogue (about 300 entries) with a Type column and sub type (category); the PM wizard and the Owner editor filter by Type, sub type and search, and Type/category round-trip in the Excel sheet. Existing customised catalogues are untouched. "Alarm Dashboard" is renamed "Alarms" and gains the location tree filter, with red flashing beacons at each location holding an open alarm and at every parent above it. The left navigation bar now always uses the light-mode primary colour. Asset, vendor and part forms get "Fill in from a link": the server fetches the page (SSRF-protected: private/loopback/metadata addresses, redirects, size and time limits) and fills empty fields, each with a clear (x). Optional Gemini refinement needs `GEMINI_API_KEY` plus an Owner toggle. Owner Tools > Features gains both toggles; they are included in the Settings sheet. New env: GEMINI_API_KEY, GEMINI_MODEL. Not build-tested in the authoring sandbox.

## v2.2

**Commit short description:** `v2.2: Workflow, settings, backup, passwords`

**Commit extended description:**
v2.2 renames work order statuses to Active / Scheduled / Completed / Closed (migrated once at start-up), auto-schedules on a scheduled date, adds bulk Auto schedule, requires a comment on Scheduled to Completed, and makes the required-by date mandatory (PM Base exempt). PM Bases get standby, manual or a yearly date range, with no backfill. Purchasing can add parts by hand. "Editions" and their env vars are removed: the Owner sets name, logo, colours, location labels, top-bar title and the Home Assistant toggle in Owner Tools. Backups are complete (comments, parts-deducted fix, users, alarms, settings, attachments index) with per-tab import, a pre-check error log, a Full backup .zip, nightly snapshots and in-browser photo shrinking. Passwords: change password, Owner temporary passwords with forced change, emailed reset (SMTP + APP_URL), session invalidation and login throttling. New env: APP_URL, BACKUP_KEEP, BACKUP_SNAPSHOTS. Not build-tested in the authoring sandbox.

## v2.1

**Commit short description:** `v2.1: Edition config, branding & terminology`

**Commit extended description:**
v2.1 extends v2's componentization with a per-deployment **edition layer**, driven by the facilities-edition decisions. `EDITION` (home | facilities) selects a preset in `backend/branding.config.js`; an optional `DATA_DIR/branding.config.js` and env vars (`BRAND_*`, `ORG_NOUN`, `LOCATION_LEVEL_LABELS`, `SITE_LEVEL_INDEX`) override it. Branding (name, logo, colours) is served at runtime from a public `/api/config`, so one image serves every fork; `/manifest.json` is now dynamic. Location hierarchy labels are configurable (Facilities: Organization, Site, Structure/Zone, Sub-zone, Area, Sub-area) but stored under stable keys, so relabelling later is display-only and Excel import accepts either. The Facilities edition turns Home Assistant off by default, and `SEED_CATALOG_FILE` loads facility PM templates as data on first run. Roles are unchanged. Adds `editions/facilities/` (env example, checklist, draft catalogue). PWA icons stay default.

## v2

**Commit short description:** `v2: Componentization (feature-flag layer)`

**Commit extended description:**
v2 delivers the componentization work deferred from v1.8: a per-
deployment feature-flag layer (`backend/features.js`) so different
MaintEnhance "editions" — the stock Home edition, a client/facility
edition — can enable only the subset of features they
need, from one codebase, with no code branch. Flags are env vars read
once at startup (`FEATURE_HA_ALARMS` for now, documented in
`.env.example` and `docker-compose.yml`) rather than an in-app Owner
setting, since which features a deployment offers is a decision made
once when it's stood up, not something end users toggle daily. The
Home Assistant alarm integration (webhook, API key, entity mapping —
v1.7) is the first componentized feature: routes it owns now 404 when
its flag is off, exactly as if they didn't exist, and the matching
setup UI disappears from the Alarm Dashboard. Nothing is deleted when a
component is turned off — historical Home-Assistant-sourced alarms and
saved mappings stay in the database and reappear if it's re-enabled.
The rest of the Alarm Dashboard (PM-checklist-triggered and manually-
raised alarms, both v1.8) is **not** part of this component and stays
on in every edition — it isn't Home-Assistant-specific. This is meant
to establish the pattern future componentized features follow.

## v1.8

**Commit short description:** `v1.8: MaintEnhance rebrand + Alarm Dashboard`

**Commit extended description:**
v1.8 rebrands the app from HomeKeep to **MaintEnhance** (short form
"ME") — across the UI, login screen, notification emails, and Excel
backup — and clears the old furnace/HVAC demo seed data entirely, so a
fresh deployment starts empty. Internally, the `household` SQLite
table becomes `app_data` (a guarded migration preserves data) and the
session cookie is renamed too, so everyone re-logs-in once after
upgrading. The former Alarms tab becomes the **Alarm Dashboard**:
alongside Home Assistant's webhook alerts (v1.7), it now also catches
a numeric PM checklist reading outside its configured expected range
(auto-raised, deduped per work order/step) and supports raising an
alarm by hand via "Create alarm." The PM Wizard's starter-maintenance
catalogue — previously hardcoded — is now editable from Owner Tools
(add/edit/remove, plus its own Excel backup/restore tab), so a
household or client edition can tune the suggested list without a code
change. This release intentionally excludes the feature-flag/
componentization layer discussed for client editions —
everything above is a normal, always-on part of the base app;
componentizing it into optional, toggleable pieces is scoped for a
future v2 release.

## v1.7

**Commit short description:** `v1.7: Home Assistant alarm integration`

**Commit extended description:**
v1.7 is the fifth and final "Bigger bets" release. HomeKeep can now
receive sensor-triggered alarms pushed from Home Assistant — a leak, a
smoke/CO alert, a freezer running warm — through a new API-key-authed
webhook (`POST /api/alarms`). Home Assistant does its own threshold,
debounce, and duration logic via its automation engine and only POSTs
when it's decided something is actually wrong; HomeKeep doesn't
re-implement any of that. Alarms land in a new "Alarms" tab (Owner/
Manager only) as their own queue, upstream of Work Requests — not
every sensor trip should become a work item. Each open alarm can be
acknowledged as a false alarm (with a reason, to help tune noisy
sensors), turned into a new Work Request with the details pre-filled,
or linked onto an existing Work Order as evidence. An entity-id-to-
asset/location mapping table means a repeat alert from the same
sensor auto-links from then on. The `source` field is modeled
generically (`home_assistant` today) so another push source could plug
into the same queue later without a redesign. The tab also surfaces
the webhook URL, a regenerable API key, and a ready-to-paste Home
Assistant `rest_command` example. Alarms and their mappings are stored
in their own SQLite tables, not the household JSON document — they're
operational/audit data, not household records, and (like v1.6's
photo files) aren't included in the Excel backup/restore.

## v1.6

**Commit short description:** `v1.6: Offline work-request sync + photos`

**Commit extended description:**
v1.6 is the fourth of five "Bigger bets" releases, and the first to
touch the backend. Work requests can now carry up to 5 photos,
attached from the phone's camera or library — a new `/api/attachments`
endpoint stores them on disk (under the same mounted data volume as
the SQLite database) and the household JSON blob only ever references
their ids, never the image bytes. More importantly, submitting a work
request now works with no connection at all: if the app is offline (or
a submission's upload fails partway through), the request and its
photos are saved to the device via IndexedDB instead of being lost,
and a "N pending sync" indicator appears in the top bar. Once the
device is back online — detected automatically, or via a manual "Sync
now" click — each queued request is uploaded and submitted for real,
in order, with failures kept in the queue (flagged in red) for the
next sync attempt rather than silently dropped. This is scoped to Work
Requests specifically (the entry point every household role, not just
Owners/Managers, already uses to report something that needs
attention) rather than direct Work Order creation, which stays an
Owner/Manager planning action; photos carry over automatically if a
request is later converted into a work order.

## v1.5

**Commit short description:** `v1.5: Address/climate-seeded PM wizard`

**Commit extended description:**
v1.5 is the third of five "Bigger bets" releases. A Property-level
location now carries an address, year built, and climate zone, and
gets a new "PM setup wizard" action (the wand icon next to it in
Location Hierarchy). Step one collects the address and year built and
guesses a climate zone from it — a simple built-in state/province
lookup, not a real climate API, always shown for the household to
confirm or override. Step two presents a curated starter list of ~13
common recurring maintenance items (HVAC filter, gutters, water
heater, furnace/AC service, sump pump, winterizing spigots, and more),
pre-checked based on that climate zone, so a Cold-zone household sees
furnace service and pipe winterizing checked while a Hot-Humid one
sees AC service and pest inspection instead. Finishing the wizard
creates a normal, fully editable PM Base for each checked item —
nothing about the wizard is special afterward; it's just a faster way
to seed a sensible starting list instead of building one from scratch.
The wizard can be re-run any time, and existing PM Bases are untouched
by it.

---

## v1.4

**Commit short description:** `v1.4: PM checklist builder`

**Commit extended description:**
v1.4 is the second of five "Bigger bets" releases. A PM Base can now
carry a **checklist template** — an ordered set of steps, each a Task
(check off), Numeric reading (with an optional expected min/max and
unit, auto-flagged in/out of spec), Photo required (tracked as an
acknowledgment checkbox for now — actual photo attachment is planned
for the offline-sync release), or Pass/Fail. The template is built and
reordered from the PM Base's own detail view, same as its trigger
configuration, and is copied fresh onto every PM occurrence the base
generates from then on.

Filling in the checklist on a live PM work order is treated like
adding a comment rather than editing the record: any user with write
access — including an Executor, who otherwise gets a read-only view of
a work order's other fields — can check off steps, log readings, and
mark pass/fail while doing the work, and each change saves
immediately. The filled-in checklist stays on the completed work order
permanently, turning a PM from a single checkbox into a real
inspection record. Existing PM Bases and occurrences are unaffected —
a PM Base with no checklist template behaves exactly as before.

---

## v1.3

**Commit short description:** `v1.3: Meter & seasonal PM triggers`

**Commit extended description:**
v1.3 is the first of five "Bigger bets" releases, split out one version
at a time. It extends PM Base templates with a **trigger type**
alongside the existing calendar mode: **Meter** (usage-based) and
**Seasonal** (tied to a season rather than a fixed date). Assets gain
an optional meter unit and current reading (e.g. "247 hours"), logged
from the asset's detail page; a meter-based PM Base tracks an interval
against that reading (e.g. every 250 hours) and generates its next
work order automatically the moment the logged reading crosses the
threshold — no PM sits scheduled ahead of time the way calendar PM
does. Seasonal PM Bases run every year around the start of a chosen
season (Northern Hemisphere meteorological boundaries: Mar 1 / Jun 1 /
Sep 1 / Dec 1), shiftable by a day offset for things like "before
heating season" or "first hard frost" that don't fall on the same
calendar date every year.

This was deliberately done as a schema change now, before more PM
schedules exist under the old calendar-only model — later versions
build on the same PM Base record rather than needing a migration.
Existing calendar-mode PM Bases are unaffected; the new trigger type
defaults to "calendar" everywhere it's read.

---

## v1.2

**Commit short description:** `v1.2: Warranties, QR labels, failure codes`

**Commit extended description:**
v1.2 ships the "quick wins" batch of the pending-changes log. Assets
gain a manual/manufacturer-page link and an "is this a major asset?"
flag; major assets get a printable QR label (generated client-side)
that deep-links straight to that asset's record — scanning it, or
opening the link directly, jumps to the asset detail view and offers
a one-tap "New work order" action, which now also exists as a button
on every asset's page regardless of QR use. Corrective and Unplanned
work orders gained optional Failure code (a fixed list: Wear, Leak,
Electrical, Mechanical, User Error, Install Defect, Unknown, Other)
and free-text Root cause fields, both included in Excel backup/restore
round-tripping and shown on the work order's detail view.

v1.2 also adds an entirely opt-in daily email digest: with an SMTP
server configured via environment variables, each household member
can set a notification email and choose which of three digests they
want (overdue work orders, warranties expiring soon, unreviewed work
requests) from a new bell icon next to their entry in Owner Tools.
With no SMTP host configured, nothing changes — the server logs once
at startup that notifications are disabled.

---

## v1.1

**Commit short description:** `v1.1: Add light/dark theme support`

**Commit extended description:**
v1.1 adds a dark theme. Every color in the app was already routed
through one design-token object (`C`); that object now resolves to
CSS custom properties instead of hard-coded hex values, with a light
and a dark palette defined for those properties, so existing
component styles needed no per-component dark-mode logic.

By default the app follows the device/browser's `prefers-color-scheme`
setting automatically — no action needed. A theme button in the top
bar (next to the install-app button) lets the user override that:
tapping it cycles Auto → Light → Dark → Auto, with a matching
monitor/sun/moon icon, and the choice is remembered in the browser via
localStorage so it persists across visits without needing an account
setting.

The dark palette keeps the same navy/orange/olive/rust/gold/teal
accent identity as light mode, just rebalanced for contrast on a dark
charcoal-green background instead of the light sage one, so status
colors, tags, and priority badges stay recognizable in either theme.

A few surfaces hard-coded to white (input fields, the "open link"
button, calendar day cells, quantity +/- buttons) now use the
theme-aware panel color instead, so they no longer stay white in dark
mode.

No backend or data changes in this release.

---

## v1 — official release

**Commit short description:** `v1: Make the app mobile-friendly`

**Commit extended description:**
v1 is HomeKeep's first official release, following the v0.1–v0.8
pre-release builds, and focuses on mobile usability. The app had no
responsive CSS: fixed-width inline styles meant the sidebar
permanently ate a third of a phone screen and multi-column layouts
got crushed. This adds a responsive pass at an 860px breakpoint, with
no backend or data changes.

Navigation: the sidebar is now an off-canvas drawer on phones instead
of pushing content aside — closed by default below 860px, opens over
the content with a tap-to-close backdrop, and auto-closes on tapping
a menu item.

Layout: every multi-column grid collapses to one column below 860px —
Assets, Work Orders/Requests, the Schedule filter pane, the kanban
board, dashboard stat cards, PM/BOM detail grids, and multi-column
forms. Auto-fill card grids (Parts Catalogue, Vendors) already reflow
and needed no change.

Calendar: the Schedule month view keeps its true 7-day grid on mobile
(padding/font shrink instead), since it needs all 7 columns to make
sense.

Popups: add/edit dialogs open as a full-width bottom sheet on phones
instead of a small centered box.

Touch: buttons, inputs, and selects get a comfortable minimum tap
height, and inputs use a larger font to avoid iOS's zoom-on-focus
behavior.

## v0.8

**Commit message:** `Add version-numbered releases and a project changelog`

- Introduced version-numbered filenames for every future delivery —
  this release is `homekeep-docker-v0.8.zip` and
  `Home_CMMS_Functional_Specification-v0.8.md`
- Added this changelog, backfilled with an entry for every version
  delivered so far (v0.1–v0.7)
- Bumped the in-app footer version string to match

---

## v0.7

**Commit message:** `Remove bundled Caddy; publish to Docker Hub; pure image-based compose deploy`

- Removed the bundled Caddy reverse proxy (`Caddyfile`, the `caddy`
  service, and its volumes) — HTTPS/reverse-proxy setup is now
  documented as "bring your own" (Caddy, Nginx Proxy Manager, Traefik,
  or a tunnel), rather than shipped by default
- Removed the `build:` section from `docker-compose.yml` entirely —
  the stack now only ever pulls a prebuilt image, which is what fixes
  Portainer's "failed to read dockerfile" error when deploying from a
  pasted compose file with no accompanying source tree
- Switched CI publishing from GitHub Container Registry to **Docker
  Hub** (`.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml`), requiring
  `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` / `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN` repo secrets
- Rewrote `README.md` accordingly, including a new "Prebuilding the
  image" section (local build, tagging, pushing, multi-arch builds,
  and moving an image to a machine with no registry access)

## v0.6

**Commit message:** `Restrict PM Base concurrency, lock down Executor edit rights, fix 500 error on non-Owner user creation`

- **Bug fix:** the 500 error when adding any user other than Owner —
  root cause was a stale SQLite `CHECK` constraint left over from
  before the role system expanded; added a real migration that
  rebuilds the `users` table and preserves existing accounts
- PM Base templates now cap at one Open/In Progress child work order
  at a time; a new occurrence is never generated while another from
  the same base is still active
- Field editing on a work order (including PM Base, now editable for
  the first time) is Owner/Manager only; an Executor opening the same
  work order gets a read-only view and can only change status
  (excluding Verified) and add comments
- Added **Save & Close** alongside **Save changes** on work order and
  PM Base detail views
- Locations page rebuilt as a collapsible tree with Expand/Collapse
  all, with a distinct icon per location level
- Added a work-order-type filter to the Work Orders page

## v0.5

**Commit message:** `Add household roles, Parts Catalogue, PM Base scheduling, and a redesigned dashboard`

- Expanded and renamed roles: Owner, **Manager** (new — Owner-level
  rights, but can only delete records they created, and can't reach
  Owner Tools), Executor (renamed from Household Member), **Guest**
  (new — read-only)
- New **Parts Catalogue** (renamed from Inventory): permanent part
  numbers, manufacturer/manufacturer-part-number/cost/link fields
- Work orders and work requests can now have parts attached/suggested,
  with a location- and BOM-scoped part search and quantities
- Priorities renamed to High/Medium/Low, added to work orders (not
  just requests), with filters on both screens
- Added Executor assignment on work orders, drawn from Owner/Manager/
  Executor accounts
- **PM Base**: a new work-order type acting as a template for
  recurring maintenance — Non-fixed (frequency-based) or Fixed
  (annual calendar dates) — auto-generating numbered PM occurrences
- Verified work orders older than 30 days move into a searchable
  archive, linked from the Verified column header
- Work requests gained a required-by date, a suggested work order
  type, and suggested parts
- Dashboard redesigned: clickable stat cards that jump to a filtered
  view, an Upcoming Work Orders panel, and a 7-day look-ahead strip
- Added unsaved-changes protection (Save/Discard/Cancel) to the major
  forms, collapsible location filters with Expand/Collapse all, an
  info icon with a Purpose/Workflow/Permissions/Features summary on
  every page, a red-bold-asterisk convention for required fields, and
  delete-from-popup for work orders/requests
- New **Owner Tools** page: member management, Excel backup/restore,
  and delete-by-number for work orders and requests
- Functional spec rewritten to reflect all of the above (v2.0/2.1)

## v0.4

**Commit message:** `Allow editing submitted work requests; support subpath deployment behind a reverse proxy`

- Work requests can now be edited (by their submitter, or by an Owner)
  while still awaiting review
- Added `VITE_BASE_PATH` build-time support so the frontend can be
  built for a subpath deployment (e.g. `example.com/homekeep/`)
  instead of only the domain root — fixed the absolute-path asset/API
  references that would otherwise break under a subpath
- Documented both a dedicated-subdomain and a subpath deployment path
  behind Caddy, plus step-by-step instructions for packaging the PWA
  as an Android APK via Bubblewrap/PWABuilder

## v0.3

**Commit message:** `Make the container port configurable via environment variable`

- `PORT` is now a single environment variable read by
  `docker-compose.yml`, the `Dockerfile` default, and the backend's
  own fallback, instead of being hardcoded to 8080

## v0.2

**Commit message:** `Add GitHub Actions CI and Portainer deployment docs`

- Added `.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml` to build and publish
  the image automatically on push
- Updated `docker-compose.yml` to pull the published image by default,
  with a local `build:` fallback
- Added `LICENSE` and `.gitignore`, and documented both Portainer
  deployment methods (Git-repository stack and pasted Web-editor
  stack) in `README.md`

## v0.1

**Commit message:** `Package HomeKeep as a standalone Docker deployment with PWA support`

- Converted the original in-chat React prototype into a real
  deployable app: Node/Express + SQLite backend with username/password
  accounts, served alongside the built React frontend from a single
  Docker image
- Added a PWA manifest, service worker, and generated app icon so the
  app installs on Android and Chromium desktop browsers
- First delivery of `homekeep-docker.zip`, with `docker-compose.yml`,
  `Dockerfile`, and a `README.md` covering local setup
